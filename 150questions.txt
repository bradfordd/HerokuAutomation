1. What is Exploratory testing?
Exploratory testing is a hands-on approach in which testers are involved in minimum planning and maximum test 
execution. The planning involves the creation of a test charter, a short declaration of the scope of a short 
(1 to 2 hour) time-boxed test effort, the objectives and possible approaches to be used. The test design and test 
execution activities are performed in parallel typically without formally documenting the test conditions, test 
cases or test scripts. This does not mean that other, more formal testing techniques will not be used. For example, 
the tester may decide to use boundary value analysis but will think through and test the most important boundary 
values without necessarily writing them down. Some notes will be written during the
 exploratory-testing session so that a report can be produced afterward.
